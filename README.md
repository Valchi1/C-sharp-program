# Software Development 

This is a small console based application using c# that willl process student marks. It demonstrates the unserstanding and successful use of :
• Data types and variables 
• Sequence programming
• Conditional statements 
• Calculation

A typical user interaction is listed below:

A user will start by entering a student name and then a student number. The student number is in the format of a 9 digit number and the system must validate and check that what the user enters is acceptable. The user must now enter 6 different module marks separately and these marks must fall within the range of 0 -100. Any lower or higher values must not be accepted. Once the marks are entered, a grade average is calculated. If the grade average is equal to 40 or higher, then the student has passed, otherwise they have failed. 

The application will finish by displaying the students name and student number, their individual module marks, their module average and a confirmation if they have passed or failed. 

For the purpose of this system, data does not need to persist longer than the application is running.
